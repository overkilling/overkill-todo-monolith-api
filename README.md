![CI](https://github.com/overkilling/overkill-todo-monolith-api/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

An overkill implementation of a backend API for serving todos, implemented in Go and backed by a Postgres database.
It is a monolith as it handles todos, users, events and anything else the Todo frontend needs.
It is an overkill as it is far too overengineered for a pet project, implementing authentication, pact tests and observability.

## Overview

The current architecture of the Todo application follows the Box-Box-Container model, or BBC for short.
It splits the architecture concerns into three layers: presentation, business logic and persistence.
In the context of the Todo application:

* The presentation layer is a [React Single Page Application (SPA)](https://github.com/overkilling/overkill-todo-spa-frontend)
* The business logic is a [Golang API](https://github.com/overkilling/overkill-todo-monolith-api)
* The persistence is a [Postgres database](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Below is colorful architecture diagram:

This is a fairly [standard architecture style](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PresentationDomainDataLayering.html), and it could considered a good starting point for most applications.
If/when an application grows in complexity and features, other patterns could be considered, such as  microservices, event sourcing, CQRS and other.
Hopefully these other patterns will be explored in other overkill implementations, so they can be evaluated and compared.

## Getting started

Clone the codebase to your local environment:

```
git@github.com:overkilling/overkill-todo-monolith-api.git
```

### Running the application

To quickly start the application from the cloned code, you can run the following:

```
make run
```

To run it through Docker, you can use the following `docker-compose` command (the `--build` will generate a new docker image):

```
docker-compose --build up
```

There is also the [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/overkilling/overkill-todo-infrastructure), which contains instructions and code to run the whole application locally, including the frontend and the observability stack (`fluentd`, `elasticsearch`, etc).


### Testing

There three levels of tests: unit, integration and pact tests. You can run them by:

```
make unit
make integration
make pact
make all # runs all of the above
```

## Endpoints

Note that, as there are currently no notion of users, all endpoints fetch and modify a global state.

### `GET /todos`

Lists all todos.

Example response:

```
[
  { "todo": "Some todo" },
  { "todo": "Another todo" },
  { "todo": "Yet another todo" }
]
```
